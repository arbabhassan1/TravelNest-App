# TravelNest APP

TravelNest is a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) application designed to facilitate property rental, akin to platforms like Airbnb. It offers a seamless user experience, allowing individuals to create accounts or log in to existing ones, enabling them to list their properties for rent.

## Features

- User Authentication
Users can create new accounts with unique credentials or log in using existing ones. Authentication ensures secure access to the platform and personalized experiences.
- Property Listing Creation:
 Property owners can easily create listings for their properties. They can provide detailed descriptions, upload pictures showcasing their properties, set availability dates, and specify rental rates.
- Review System:
 A review system is integrated into the platform to enhance transparency and trust between property owners and potential renters. Users can leave feedback and ratings based on their rental experiences, fostering accountability and improving overall customer satisfaction.
- Property Viewing:
 Renters can browse through listings, view property details, and assess available amenities through descriptive text and images. This allows them to make informed decisions before renting out a property.
- Booking and Rental Management:
 The app facilitates the booking process, allowing users to select available dates and initiate rental requests. Property owners can manage bookings, approve rental requests, and communicate with renters through the platform.
 - Messaging System:
  An in-app messaging system enables seamless communication between property owners and renters. This feature streamlines the rental process, allowing users to ask questions, discuss rental terms, and coordinate logistics directly within the platform.
